           <h2>Old Project Done!</h2>
           <p>I started working on this project three years ago. I haven't worked on it since because I did not need its functionality. Originally this software was used to fetch mouse data on a game to assist in making an auto bot that farmed the game.</p>
           <p>When looking through my stuff recently, I found this and thought of making it into a nice app with a gui for the average user. The app was just a tooltip that was always on when the app luanches and it had only the needed values. To make it nicer, I added a clean and simple gui (graphical user interface). Also I added extra information to be displayed so the app can be used for web and graphics design rather than just getting the mouse position for a game.</p>
           
           <div class="col_a2 float_l" style="border:none; background:none;">
            <p>It is written using AutoIt 3 scripting language. The software is able to capture mouse position and the color at that position. The software has many features including:
            <ul type="disc">
            <li>Live preview of values</li><br />
            <li>Color info is displayed and stored in many forms: RGB (red green blue) HEX (hexadecimal) HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) and HSL percentages.</li><br />
            <li>Overlay mode for directX applications (games)</li><br />
            <li>Store values to a txt file</li><br />
            <li>Load values from the txt file</li><br />
            <li>Stop capturing hotkey (for ingame use)</li></ul></p>
