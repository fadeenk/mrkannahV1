        <h3>Wireless Arduino LED Piano</h3>
        <div class="col_a2 float_l" style="border:none; background:none;">
        <p>An Arduino application that utilizes a combination of three softwares to make a LEDs responds to a piano key press on a phone while playing a specific frequency that is controllable by a physical knob. The piano presses are sent through a phone to the computer then the computer shows the user the presess live on screen. Since the computer is connected to the arduino it is always communicating with it which provides very low delay and real-time output/input through the LEDs and the potentiometer (knob).</p>
        <p>The software is written so it supports multiple key presses at the same time and it plays a combination of those sounds (like a real piano). Also the Graphical representation has the sound waves drawn at all time.</p>
        <p>Information on how to do this, is available in the video description along with the code, libraries used, schematic and the wiring of all components.</p>

        <h3>RGB Guessing Game</h3>
        <div class="col_a2 float_r" style="border:none; background:none; width:480px; margin-left:15px; margin-top:-15px;">
        <p>An Arduino game that uses a combination of three knobs (potentiometers) to control a color. The game generates a random color and the user has to generate the same color or a color close to it using the knobs. The game includes multiple difficulty levels and it includes instructions on how to play the game. Each difficulty level has its own time limit and value tolerance. Also the game plays a beeping sound when the user passes the correct value range and the game has a background music playing. </p>
