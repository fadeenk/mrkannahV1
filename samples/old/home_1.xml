<p align="left">I am Fadee Kannah, an Iraqi student at San Diego State University whose goal is to become a computer engineer. I chose computer engineering as my major because of my passion towards technology and computers. I realized that my future will be based on this passion since I was twelve when I held a computer mouse for the first time.</p>

<p align="left">My love for computers made me explore things that I didnâ€™t know about. It made me teach myself how to setup a network, design a webpage, code simple software, fix a problem and become a computer engineer. This passion motivates me to keep on learning and exploring the massive realm of technology.</p>]]></content>
