		<content><![CDATA[<span class="note">Librarian</span>
<p align="left">I volunteered in the library branch of El Cajon as a librarian. During my volunteering time I sorted books on the shelves, guided people to the books they wanted, and taught some people how to use the internet to find books that they were looking for and a lot more.

		<content><![CDATA[<span class="note">Tutor</span>
<p align="left">I tutored for middle school students. I tutored math ranging from basic math to algebra and geometry. Also, I tutored English. Many of the students that I tutored for English were Chaldean, so I also translated for them.

		<content><![CDATA[<span class="note">Translator</span>
<p align="left">I did not only translate for the students that I tutored but also translated for other people and the other librarians. I translated for Arabic and Chaldean speakers who did not know enough English or did not understand what the librarians were saying. Also, I translated for the librarians when they needed me to make phone calls or communicate with another person.</p> ]]></content>
